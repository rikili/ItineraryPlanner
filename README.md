# ItineraryPlanner

The Itinerary Planner program allows a user to login to their account and modify the different properties of a trip that they plan to take. Properties of the trip involve accommodation plans, attractions they may visit, and some other information they may want to keep track of.

With our itinerary planner program we were able to merge our knowledge of SQL into creating an app that manages trip plannings. We were able to implement basic and lightly complex queries into our operations to ensure that the app was usable to an extent. The project helped us learn not only the complexity and rigidity of SQL, but also how databasing permits us to easily execute operations that otherwise may generate difficult to handle errors.T
